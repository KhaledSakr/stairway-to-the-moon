# Stairway to the Moon
The only way to go is up, and to the right, make humanity proud.

## Description
This game was made for GitHub Game Off 2020 and using ROT.js and some UI elements in React. It's quite simple, but I hope someone finds it enjoyable.

The game was made in a rush, so it might not have the most extensible API, but levels can simply be created by adding one more `Game` component to the levels array in [controller.tsx](src/controller.tsx). In addition to the currently implemented actors, you can add a new actor by implementing the interface [Actor](src/actors/abstract.ts).

## Play It
